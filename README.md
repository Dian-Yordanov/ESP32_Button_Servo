# ESP32_Button_Servo

This project is a simplified version of [Dian-Yordanov's ArduinoServoHC05AndPotentiometerControl](https://github.com/Dian-Yordanov/ArduinoServoHC05AndPotentiometerControl) . It achieves the same goal but in a much simpler, faster, and more cost-effective way, using more reliable materials. Instead of a potentiometer and Bluetooth, it uses just a buttonâ€”a reduction in complexity that works perfectly for the specific use case.

The sketch for the project is on https://wokwi.com/projects/418571808970566657
